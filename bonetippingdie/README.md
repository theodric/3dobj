** work in progress **

This will (hopefully eventually) be a comprehensive set of 3D-printable hand press dies for tipping spiral steel boning used in the making of corsets.

As of 2016-03-15, only a 6mm die set is available. I printed this in REAL-branded PLA. The CTE of your material may be different, resulting in a poor fit between upper and lower die. The hex pattern in the top half is designed to accept an M8 bolt, cut to the appropriate length for your press. Check that your press actually requires M8. (Most of the Chinese presses do.)
