I needed a tag for a child's package, so I sliced off the top of the Nijntje face model created by another user. If I could be bothered, I'd add a hole or loop in the STL file, but I'm lazy so I'll just use a drill bit. Feel free to improve it. Thanks to <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/Xiaojun/about">Xiaojun</a> for the source file.
