<h3><b>Harbor Freight "Pittsburgh" dial caliper thumb roller holder</h3>

Forget Rev3; Rev4b is the biznes. I could keep iterating on this thing forever, I suspect.

Since Cura does a bad job of supporting the inside of the U shape, I've included a second version of the Rev4b STL file that includes MeshMixer supports baked into the model.</b>

This is a replacement bracket for the Pittsburgh dial caliper's thumb roller. There are other versions of this part available on Thingiverse that are more elegant or more faithful to the design of the original part, but I've tried instead to design a bit more strength into this one, at the expense of appearances.

Print it at 100% infill, slowly, positioned horizontally, standing up with the U shape inverted on the print bed, with heavy-duty supports. Minimal postprocessing is required.
